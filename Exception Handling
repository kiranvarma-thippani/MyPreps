Exception Handling in java

Exception is an event which disrupts the normal flow of progream and halts the program execution. Basically this exception occurs
due to abnormality in the program. Exception is a object contains the info about the exception created by jvm and throws when an exception
occurs and if it is not handled properly then the program gets terminated.

There are two types of exceptions in jave:
1. Checked Exception.
2. Unchecked Exception.
3. Error

Checked Exception:
The Exception which are checked at compile time by the compiler is said to be checked exception. Basically compiler enforces us to
provide the exception handling logic or to declare the exception that it throws:

Unchecked Exceptions:
These exceptions are not caught during the compile time. These type of exceptions basically occur during the execution of program.
These occur due to the error in the programming logic or improper use of the API etc.

Hierarchy:
==========

=> All the exceptions are the subclasses of the Exception class
=> The Exception class is the subclass of throwable class.
=>Error is also the subclass of throwable class.

Exception class has two subclasses they are: 
1. Checked Exception
2. Unchecked Exception.


Important Methods of throwable class:

getMessage(): Returns a detailed message about the exception that has occurred. This message is initialized in the Throwable constructor.
public Throwable getCause(): Cause of the exception.
public String toString(): returns the class concatinated with the message of the exception.
printStackTrace(): prints the message and stacktrace.
 
 A stack trace in Java is a report that shows the sequence of method calls that led to an exception being thrown. It helps developers understand
 where and why an error occurred in the code.
 
 =>Exceptions handled using try, catch, finally block. every try should have catch or finally block(usually for closing resources).
 => the code prone to throw an exception is placed in try block and handled in catch block. irrespective of error handling finally  executes.
 
=> If finally block itself throws exception then the exceptions in try and catch blocks are overridden.
=> For every try block there can be multiple catches. Each catches will having a specific exception handling logic. The exceptions in the 
catch block should be decreasing in heirarchy else compiler throw exception like unreachable coe.


Throw vs Throws:
============
1. If a method does not handle the checke exception it atleast should be declared in the method declaration. We can have declare multiple 
exceptions for the same method using throws keyword. It just postpones the exception handling.
2. Throw keyword is used to throw a particular exception explicitly. This is very useful while throwing the custom exceptions in java.

Important Points:
-> No catch without try.
>Finally is compuslion when you have try/catch
-> try should contain a catch or finally block compulsory
-> No other code in between these try ,catch blocks and finally blocks.

try-with-resources, also referred as automatic resource management, is a new exception handling mechanism that was introduced in Java 7, 
which automatically closes the resources used within the try catch block.

To use this statement, you simply need to declare the required resources within the parenthesis, and the created resource will be closed 
automatically at the end of the block.

Rules of Try-With-Resources

1. Resource must implement AutoCloseable or Closeable interface.

Examples: FileInputStream, BufferedReader, Connection, etc.

2. Resources are declared inside the parentheses of the try block.

3. Java will automatically close them when the block exits (even if an exception occurs).

4. You can declare multiple resources separated by semicolons.


Built in Compile time exceptions:

1. IO
2. SQl
3. File Not Found
4. Class Not found.
5. Interrupted Exception
6. ParseException.
7. NoSuchMethodException
8. InstantiationException
9. NoSuchFieldException

Built in Runtime Exception:
1. Null Pointer Exception.
2. ArrayIndexOutOfBounds
3. Arithmetic Exception.
4. IllegalArguementException.
5. IllegalStateException
6. NumberFormatException improper string to number  conversion
7. UnsupportedOperationException.
8. ConcurrentModificationException.


Imp points for try wit resources:
===================================
To use a class with try-with-resources statement it should implement AutoCloseable interface and the close() method of it gets invoked automatically at runtime.

You can declare more than one class in try-with-resources statement.

While you declare multiple classes in the try block of try-with-resources statement these classes are closed in reverse order.

Except the declaration of resources within the parenthesis everything is the same as normal try/catch block of a try block.

The resource declared in try gets instantiated just before the start of the try-block.

The resource declared at the try block is implicitly declared as final.


Call stack:
The call stack is a runtime structure used by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to keep track of method calls.
🧠 Think of it like:
A stack of method calls — when a method is called, it's pushed onto the stack; when it finishes, it's popped off.

Use of call stack:
-------------------
Keeps track of which method is currently executing.
Helps the JVM know where to return after a method finishes.

Keeps track of which method is currently executing.
Helps the JVM know where to return after a method finishes.

Stack trace:
------------
A stack trace is a snapshot of the call stack at the moment an exception occurs. It shows the sequence of method calls
that led to the error.
Helps debug by showing where the error happened and how the program got there.
Used in logs and error messages.
