-> It allows you to automate the repetitive tasks at regular intervals or timings.
-> @EnableSheduling on @springbootAPplication. basically on the top of application
-> We should use @schedule on the top of the method where we want to automate the process. 

Inside @schedule takes some params here() depending upon those param the task will be running at regular time intervals.

@scheduled(fixed=10000) : So this will make to run the method on its own after every 10 seconds.

But if the method itself runs for more than 10 seconds, then the job will again get submitted so this leads to the method overlaping.

-> So in order to over  come this, we use fixedDelay so that the method executes again after a fixed delay post completion of the previous invocation.

So in order to have a initial delay, we should use @scheduled(initialyDelay=10000, fixedDelay=50000);

-> Cron Expressions:

Using fixedDelay, fixed and initial delay, we just try to repeat the task or for every few seconds, or after a initial delay, we are invoking the process.

But by using all these things, we only run the jobs at regular interfaces but if we want to run a specific job at a particular day, at a particulart
time we can use cron expression.

@scheduled(cron="* * * * * *") Here the six asterisks are used to define the expression.


first * - represents seconds. 0-59

Second * - this represents minutes 0-59

third * - this represents hour 0-23

fourth * - represents day in a month 1-31

fifth * - reprsents month in a year 1-12

sixth * - represents week 0-7 here sunday is -0 or 7.


We can also have different types of symbols represents different type of config. 

* (Asterisk)
Matches all values in the field
(e.g., * * * * * * runs every second)


, (Comma)
Specifies multiple values
(e.g., 0,15,30,45 * * * * * runs at 0, 15, 30, and 45 seconds)


- (Dash)
Defines a range
(e.g., 10-20 * * * * * runs from second 10 to 20)


/ (Slash)
Specifies increments
(e.g., */5 * * * * * runs every 5 seconds)


? (Question Mark)
Used for day-of-month or day-of-week when you don’t care about the value


L (Last)
Represents the last day of the month or last day of the week


W (Weekday)
Runs on the nearest weekday to a given day
(e.g., 15W means the nearest weekday to the 15th)


# (Nth Day)
Runs on the Nth occurrence of a weekday
(e.g., 2#3 means the third Monday of the month)



Dynamic Scheduling:
==================

Creating the cron job at run time. 

We schedule the delay or the frequenceies at which the job should run,  before deploying the app and once it deployed we cant change the cron job settings

So in order to get rid of that, we use dynamic scheduling of the cron job.

One ways is we persists the values in DB and we update the cron values in the DB and use it in cron expression. Thus dynamic schedule take place.

In order to work with dynamic task scheduling, we use scheduledTaskExecutor which is provided by the spring framework. We set the bean and intialise f the same.

By Default it uses defaulthreadpooltaskexecutor, so if want multiple threads, we can make use of threadpooltaskexecutor . we create a bean in the config 
class and then use it. In case of multithreating we make use of @Async. In case of .cancel() and .schedule we use threadpooltaskexecutor here.

ConditionalOnProperty(name = "scheduler.enabled", havingValue = "true")

🔧 Parameters of @ConditionalOnProperty:

name: The name of the property to check.
havingValue: The value that must match for the bean to be created.
matchIfMissing: (Optional) If set to true, the bean will be created even if the property is missing.

For cron job in our teleco domain. Runtime.getRuntime().exec("ssh user@openvms-host 'run cleanup_command'");
 

 For the APIs I develop, I focus on unit testing and component-level testing to ensure the business logic, validations, and error handling are working correctly.
We have a dedicated QA or integration team that handles end-to-end integration testing, including how our APIs interact 
with other services or front-end systems.
